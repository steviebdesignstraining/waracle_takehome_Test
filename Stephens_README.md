    <h2 class="emoji">👋 Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Before we launch into the <strong>code-verse</strong>, I’d like to take a moment to introduce myself.</p>
    <p>My name is <strong>Stephen Bennett</strong>, and I truly appreciate you taking the time to consider me for the QA role on your team.</p>
    <p>With over <strong>12 years of experience in software testing</strong>, I bring enthusiasm, technical skill, and a collaborative spirit to every project. I’m an ambivert with a touch of <strong>Looney Tunes energy</strong>, known for being friendly, adaptable, and always optimistic.</p>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the take-home challenge and—full disclosure—I got a bit carried away! I created <strong>two full automation frameworks</strong> in <strong>Cypress</strong> and <strong>Playwright</strong>, and almost spun up a third with <strong>Python/Selenium</strong>. I also created detailed <strong>manual test plans</strong> to guide my strategy and development.</p>
    <p>Let’s dive into what I’ve built! 👇</p>

    <h2>🧭 Overview</h2>
    <p>This project contains <strong>automated browser tests</strong> for a simple MVP online shop built by Waracle. The goal is to validate core functionality and ensure confidence in ongoing development by testing key flows like login, cart, checkout, and error handling.</p>
