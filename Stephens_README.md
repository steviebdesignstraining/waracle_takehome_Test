### Introduction
Hi there! Before we have lift-off into the code-verse, I would like to take the time to introduce myself to you!! 


<img src=">
My name is Stephen Bennett and I want to thank you for taking the time the time to consider me for the QA role that your team is hiring for. 

I have been testing for over 12 years and I enjoy working in the development space. I am a bit of a LoonieToons, ambivert, friendly, positive and optimistic. I am sociable and I can work well with different personalities and can adapt in different environments. 

First off I really enjoyed completing the takehome test, that I kind of got carried away into the code-vers and I created two automation framework in Cypress and Playwright. I was close to starting a third framework in Python and Selenium, but maybe that would be pushing it, so I created manual test plans to guide me with planning and writing my scripts. 

So lets get into what I have done!  

### Overview
This project contains automated browser tests for a simple MVP online shop built by Waracle. The goal is to validate the core functionality of the site and provide confidence in ongoing development by covering key user flows such as login, product display, cart actions, and error handling.

🔍 Scope
Automated testing of core user scenarios using multiple test accounts:

✅ standard_user: Expected normal behavior

❌ locked_out_user: Should fail to log in

⚠️ problem_user: Images fail to load

🐢 performance_glitch_user: Tests resilience under load delays

Tests are implemented using [your chosen testing framework] and follow best practices in automation and QA.

Focused on functionality, maintainability, and completeness, with production-level structure and documentation.

### Brief Overview
As mentioned in my introduction, I have created a manual test plan, outlining the key user flows, cases, and scenarios that I have automated. The test plan is designed to cover the most fundamental features of the online shop, ensuring that critical functionalities are thoroughly tested.
